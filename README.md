# portfolio-manager-pybot

This is a trading bot for Interactive Brokers that implements the options wheel strategy.
You need to use the PHP UI to manager settings.
I do not maintain this code base anymore as I rewrote it using Nodejs with a cleaner code. Please look https://github.com/rylorin/portfolio-manager-nodebot
